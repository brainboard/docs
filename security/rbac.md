# Role Based Access Control

### Definition

RBAC allows you to give/restrict access to resources based on the role of the user. Brainboard uses this mechanism to allow you to restrict or allow access to your organization and projects.

### Level of access

As the owner or admin of the organization, you have 2 levels of access:

1.  Organization

    RBAC defined in this level concerns only access to your organization.

    Please refer to the [organization RBAC](broken-reference) for more details about the roles of users and how you can adjust it.
2.  Project

    RBAC of this level concerns access to projects (including their environments and architectures)

    Please refer to the [RBAC for projects](../data/data-structure/projects.md#project-iam-reference) for more details about the roles you can use to configure access to your projects.

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the section [Roles & permissions](../deployment-and-settings/settings/rbac/) to learn how to configure the roles and permissions.
{% endhint %}
