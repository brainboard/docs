# Environment

An `environment` is a logical grouping of cloud architectures that are supposed to have the same criticality or serve the same purpose. Like dev, staging, QA, prod...

Environments can be used to separate and `isolate` development, staging, and production resources, or to create dedicated environments for different teams or applications.
