# Environment

### Description

An `environment` is a logical grouping of cloud architectures that are supposed to have the same criticality or serve the same purpose. Like dev, staging, QA, prodâ€¦

Environments can be used to separate and `isolate` development, staging, and production resources, or to create dedicated environments for different teams or applications.

### Synchronize architectures across environments

Refer to the [Architecture Synchronization](cloud-architecture/environment-sync.md) to know more about it.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage multiple environments in Brainboard and ensure that your infrastructure is consistent and reliable across all stages. This is the best way to eliminate the drift between different environments.
