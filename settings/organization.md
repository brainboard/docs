# Organization

### Description

The Organization is a common space that is supposed to host projects accessible to the same group of people or teams.

The first account created on Brainboard will be, by default, the owner of the organization and Brainboard creates automatically a new team and new project for this account as part of the onboarding process.

If you are planning to work with your colleagues in the same organization, you should invite them or add them to the same SSO group.
{% endhint %}

### Roles within an organization

There are 4 default roles within the organization.

#### 1. Owner

The owner of the organization can perform any action. It is usually the first account created.

#### 2. Admin

The admin can perform any action on the organization except deleting it and managing billing information.

#### 3. Member

At the organization level, a member can:

* List other members
* List and create teams
* List and create projects.

Members cannot invite users or delete them. They cannot see or change the billing and they only see projects they have access to and not all projects.

#### 4. Guest

Guest is a read-only user that only has access to projects that admins or owners allowed it to access.

By default, a guest has access to nothing.
