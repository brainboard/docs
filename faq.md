# Frequently Asked Questions ðŸ‘‹

### Do I need to be Terraform expert to use Brainboard?

No. You don't need to be a Terraform or IaC expert to use Brainboard. But minimum knowledge of Terraform is required to fully take advantage of Brainboard.

In fact, Brainboard simplifies the complexity of Terraform and helps you configure cloud resources with a configuration menu. It will then write clean Terraform code for you, according to best practices.

ðŸŽ’ We also help the community by providing free Terraform trainings, that you can find in our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB0DLhFEgta83U62mQzxGPg).

### What is the difference between Brainboard and vanilla Terraform?

Terraform is a powerful IaC tool that deploys the code you write.

Brainboard, on the other hand, is an end-to-end cloud management solution built on top of Terraform with a visual architecture designer, where the Terraform code is automatically generated. It also has a secure CI/CD engine, native Git integrations and more features to help you standardize and centralize your cloud.
