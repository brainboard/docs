# Locals

A **local value** assigns a name to an [expression](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions), so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression.&#x20;

Brainboard allows you to define multiple locals.

{% hint style="success" %}
When you define locals in Brainboard, they are added to the `locals.tf` file and in the same block `locals`&#x20;
{% endhint %}

_The table of locals is similar to the one of variables detailed above. Please refer to it to understand the different components of the user interface._

If you are using a complex expression in the value field, you need to quote it as you can mix strings, functions, variables....
