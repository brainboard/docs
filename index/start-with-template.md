# Start with a template ⚜️

One of the fastest way to start with Brainboard, is to start by a template.

You can access the template catalogue from the design area with the button `Templates`:

![Templates](<../.gitbook/assets/templates-button (1).png>)

You can search by keyword any architecture, for e.g. `landing zone`, `kubernetes`, `security`... or select your preferred cloud provider to only see the templates architectures for this specific provider:

![Templates](../.gitbook/assets/templates.png)

:::tip There are 2 types of templates: **public** and **private**.

When you first create your account, you only see the public ones but you can convert any architecture that you make into a private template. Which allows you to build your internal library of templates to use off the shelf. :::
