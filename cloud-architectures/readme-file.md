* Usage instructions: A step-by-step guide on how to use the architecture, including any variables and configuration settings.
* Support and contact information: Details on how to get support or contact the development team, such as through email, forums, or social media.
* Release notes: A list of changes, bug fixes, and new features for each release of the architecture.
