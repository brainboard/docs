#### Organization owner

The first account created on Brainboard will be, by default, the owner of the organization and Brainboard creates automatically a new team and new project for this account as part of the onboarding process.

* First name
* Last name
* Email address: you need to reach out to the support at support@brainboard.co to change your email address
