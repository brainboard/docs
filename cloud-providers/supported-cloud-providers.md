# Supported cloud providers ðŸŽ©

### Cloud provider definition

A **Terraform cloud provider** is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with a specific cloud provider's API to create, manage, and delete resources. Each cloud provider has its own set of resources and data sources that can be used to define and manage infrastructure with Terraform.

You can use the provider block to specify which cloud provider you are using and configure its settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
This block is typically placed at the top of a Terraform configuration file, and you can specify multiple providers to manage resources across multiple cloud providers
{% endhint %}

### Supported cloud providers

Brainboard supports the following cloud providers:

#### Azure (Azure Resource Manager)

`AzureRM` is the Terraform provider for Azure Resource Manager (ARM), which is the service that allows you to manage Azure resources.

* It provides Terraform with the necessary API calls to interact with Azure's API and create, manage, and delete resources within your Azure account.
* When you use the AzureRM provider in Terraform, you can define resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks, and use Terraform to create, update, and delete those resources in Azure.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the Azure provider in Terraform, you need to configure it with the appropriate credentials and specify which Azure subscription and resource group you want to use.

### Providers versions

Every Terraform cloud provider has different versions for both its resources and data sources.

You can select any version from the list of versions:

![CP versions](../.gitbook/assets/cp-versions-list.png)

When you select a specific version, Brainboard loads all the resources of this version and the id-card of every resource will contain the parameters available in the selected version.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When selecting a different version, always do a `plan` to make sure that the code is valid, as most often parameters are updated between versions and some resources may be added or deleted
