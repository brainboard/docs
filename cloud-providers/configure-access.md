# Configure access ðŸšª

### Credentials' settings

To add credentials for the supported providers you need to go to the cloud providers configuration menu where you can see the list of the supported providers.

![providers\_config](../.gitbook/assets/providers\_config.png)

There are two main configurations that are common for all terraform providers:

* `Credentials` specific credentials needed to access the cloud provider
* `Scope` the scope in Brainboard where you are going to use the provider. It might be at the organizational/project/environment/architecture level.

After selecting one of the providers, you can click on the `+` button on the right and open the configuration for the provider.

### Azure RM

To configure the Azure provider (AzureRM) for Terraform, you have to specify the appropriate credentials and the subscription in which you want to create resources.

Here are the steps to configure the Azure provider:

1. Create a service principal in Azure Active Directory (AAD) with the "Contributor" role. This service principal will be used to authenticate the Terraform Azure Provider to Azure. You can create the service principal using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure Portal.
2. Once you have the service principal created, you will need to get the following information from it:
   * **subscription\_id**
   * **client\_id**
   * **tenant\_id**
   * **client\_secret**
3. Next, you need to add the information in the AzureRM configuration below:

<summary>Generate Azure credentials for Terraform</summary>

To generate Azure credentials for use with Terraform, you can use the Azure Portal.

1. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory section
2. Select App registrations and then click on New registration
3. Give a name to your app and select the appropriate account type (single or multi-tenant)
4. After creating the app, go to Certificates & secrets and create a new client secret
5. Go to the Subscription's Access control (IAM) to add a new role assignment
6. Assign the appropriate role (e.g. Contributor) to the app created above

Tips:

* `ARM SUBSCRIPTION ID`: you will find it in the Subscription's Overview
* `ARM CLIENT ID`: you will find it in the App registrations' Overview with the name `Application (client) ID`
* `ARM TENANT ID`: you will find it in the App registrations' Overview with the name `Directory (tenant) ID`
* `ARM CLIENT SECRET`: you will find it in the App registrations' Certificates & secrets, you must copy the client `secret Value` (not the Secret ID).

<summary>Generate GCP credentials for Terraform</summary>

To generate GCP credentials for Terraform, you will need to create a service account in the Google Cloud Console. Here are the steps to generate GCP credentials:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) and select your project.
2. In the navigation menu, click on the hamburger icon (â‰¡) and then select "IAM & admin" and then "Service accounts"

4. In the "Create service account" form, give a name to the service account and provide a brief description.
5. Under "Role", select the role that you want to assign to the service account. This role will determine the actions that Terraform can perform with the service account.
6. Click on "Create" to create the service account.
7. Once the service account is created, you will see the option to create a key. Select "JSON" as the key type and click on "Create"
8. The JSON key file will be downloaded to your local machine. This file contains the credentials for the service account and it should be kept secure.
9. Once you have the JSON key file, you can use it to authenticate the Terraform GCP Provider to GCP.

Once you have the service account created, you will have to get the following information from it:

* project\_id
* credentials file
