# Support vs Professional Services

### Definition of Support

It is an ongoing service included with your subscription that provides technical assistance, troubleshooting, and guidance to help you resolve issues and use the software's existing features effectively.

It follows predefined service level agreements (SLAs) with set response times.

**Examples:**

* You need help troubleshooting an issue (bug, deployment, or misconfiguration)
* You have questions about how a feature works
* Something is broken or not performing as expected
* You need guidance on best practices within existing setup

### Definition of Professional Services

Are specialized, sometimes project-based consulting and/or implementation services.

When you need it?

* You have a new or existing project and want consulting to know how to do it, what are the best practices and/or you want Brainboardâ€™s team to help you build it.
* You're migrating to Brainboard
* Strategic guidance on how to get more value out of the platform.
* You need training for your team after the onboarding
* You want to optimize or redesign your architectures

### **Key distinction**

**Support** is related to the product (Brainboard) and helps you maintain and use what you have, while **Professional Services** are related to your needs, to help you implement your projects or optimize existing ones.
