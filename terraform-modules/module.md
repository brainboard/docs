# Module üçü

### Description

Modules are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. Modules allow you to organize your Terraform code and reuse it across multiple projects, making it easier to manage and maintain your infrastructure as code.

There are two types of Terraform modules:

* Root modules: These are the main Terraform configurations that define your infrastructure. The root module is the top-level module in your Terraform configuration and it calls other Terraform modules as needed.
* Child modules: These are Terraform modules that are called by the root module. Child modules encapsulate a portion of your infrastructure, making it easier to manage and maintain.

When you create a Terraform module, you can use inputs and outputs to define the expected input and output values of the module:

* `Inputs` allow you to pass parameters into the module, making it more flexible and reusable.
* `Outputs` allow you to expose values from the module so that they can be used by other Terraform modules.

### Modules structure

The basic structure of a Terraform module includes:

* `Variables`: these are values that are passed into the module when it is called.
* `Resources`: The main part of a module is the collection of Terraform resources that are defined within it. These resources are used to create the infrastructure.
* `Outputs`: these are values that are returned by the module when it is called. These outputs can be used by other modules or in the root module of the Terraform configuration.

### Best practices

When using modules these best practices make your life easier:

* **Verify the source**: Before using a module from the Terraform Registry, verify the source to ensure that it's reputable and secure.
* **Review the documentation**: Review the documentation of the module to ensure that it meets your requirements and to understand how it can be used in your configuration.
* **Use version control**: Use version control to keep track of changes to the module, and make sure to use a specific version of the module in your configuration so that you are aware of any breaking changes.
* **Test the module**: Test the module thoroughly before using it in production to ensure that it works as expected and to catch any bugs or errors.
