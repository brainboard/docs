# Manage module üç±

To manage modules within Brainboard you can go to the modules catalog.

![Modules](../.gitbook/assets/modules.png)

On this page, you can see and manage all your imported modules and choose which ones you want to have displayed in the modules list in your design area by `pinning` them.

![Modules management](../.gitbook/assets/module\_management.png)

If you want to change the configuration of a module you can choose one of the modules in the list:

*   In the module configuration you can show the module in the design or remove it from the design by using the `pin` button.

    ![Edit modules](../.gitbook/assets/module\_edit.png)
* You can edit the configuration by using the `pen` button.
* You can delete the module by using the `bin` button.

:::tip

To have a more organized modules list in your design area, only `pin` the modules that are needed for a specific architecture. If you need more modules you can come later to the modules catalog and pin them.
