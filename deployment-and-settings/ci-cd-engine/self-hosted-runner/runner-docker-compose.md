# Deploy runner with docker-compose

### Pre-requisites

First, you need to have Docker installed on your server. If not already installed, please follow instructions from [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

After installing Docker, you need the following files in a directory:

{% code title="docker-compose.yml" fullWidth="false" %}
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  runner:
    image: ghcr.io/brainboard/runner:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: /brainboard-runner run
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
      - "./runner-config.yaml:/etc/brainboard-runner/config.yaml:ro"
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="runner-config.yaml" fullWidth="false" %}
```
level: warn

runner:
  concurrency: 4
  name: "self-hosted runner"
  token: "your-runner-token"

api:
  endpoint: "https://api.us1.brainboard.co"

docker:
  registry: "ghcr.io/brainboard/plugins"
  ecr_auth: false
```
{% endcode %}

### Configuration

The `runner-config.yaml` file contains Brainboard runner configuration. You can modify this file to change the configuration of the runner. It's important to note that the `runner-config.yaml` file should be in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Before starting the runner for the first time, it is mandatory to update the `runner.token` configuration value in the `runner-config.yaml` file. Update this value with the private self-hosted runner token you generated from the Brainboard settings page.

```yaml
...
runner:
  token: "your-runner-token"
...
```

This token should be unique and cannot be shared across multiple runners. If you use the same token on multiple runners, you will encounter issues when running CI/CD jobs.

### Starting the runner

To start the runner, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the docker-compose and runner-config files. The following command will start the runner in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### Register runner with your organization

Once the runner is started, you will need to register it with your organization. To do so, open a terminal inside the runner container ([see below](runner-docker-compose.md#usage)) and run the following command:

```bash
/brainboard-runner register
```

This operation only needs to be done once, when the runner is started for the first time.

### Usage

To open a terminal inside the runner container, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec runner sh
```

If you want to see the logs, you can run this command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To stop the Brainboard runner, execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose down
```
