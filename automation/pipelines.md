# Pipelines

### Description

Pipelines are the history of the execution of your workflow.

These pipelines contain both your triggered workflows and any action performed in `one action` tab.

### Pipeline information

![Pipeline info](../.gitbook/assets/pipeline-info-running.png)

#### Status

There are 7 statuses of any given pipeline:

1. **Scheduled**: the pipeline is accepted by Brainboard for execution and put in the pool to be picked by a runner.
   * By default, all jobs are accepted.
2. **Pending**: the pipeline is pending to be picked by a runner to execute it.
3. **Running**: the pipeline has been picked by a runner that is currently executing its tasks.
4. **Succeeded**: the execution of the pipeline ended, and all tasks were successful.
5. **Failed**: the execution of the pipeline ended and some of the tasks failed.
   * The pipeline is considered failed, when at least one task fails.
   * When you ignore errors in tasks to not stop the pipeline, if they fail, the pipeline is considered failed even if the execution of the last task is successful.
6. **Terminated**: the pipeline has been stopped by a user.
7. **Manual**: the pipeline requires approval. It means that at least one task of the pipeline is pending approval.
